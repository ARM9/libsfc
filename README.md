#### C library for programming the SNES ####

I have decided to abandon this library, switching to the WDC toolchain for future homebrewing because it's simply better than tcc816+wla in almost every way.

Thanks to ulrich.hecht for making https://code.google.com/p/snes-sdk which I used to get started with snes programming.
